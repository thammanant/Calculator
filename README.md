# Compiler Construction Project

## Overview

This project is a compiler construction endeavor focused on building a compiler for a simple language. The primary goal is to create a calculator application that can take source code written in the specified language and translate it into assembly code for execution.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Calculator**: Directory containing the source code and related files for the calculator application.
  - `64011658_64011594.asm`: Assembly code generated by the compiler.
  - `64011658_64011594.bracket`: Bracket file used in the compilation process.
  - `64011658_64011594.csv`: CSV file generated during compilation.
  - `64011658_64011594.grammar`: Grammar file defining the language syntax.
  - `64011658_64011594.lex`: Lexical analysis file.
  - `64011658_64011594.sdt`: Syntax-directed translation file.
  - `64011658_64011594.tok`: Token file generated during lexical analysis.
  - `README.md`: Documentation specific to the calculator application.
  - `__pycache__`: Cache directory for Python bytecode files.
  - `code_generator.py`: Code generation module.
  - `input.txt`: Sample input file for testing.
  - `parser.out`: Parser output file.
  - `parsetab.py`: Parser table file.
  - `processor.py`: Processor module for handling compilation tasks.

## Tokenization and Lexical Analysis

The lexical analysis is performed using the Ply library. The lexer reads token patterns from a file (`64011658_64011594.lex`), tokenizes the input source code, and writes the tokenized output to `64011658_64011594.tok`.

## Grammar Parsing

The grammar parsing is implemented using Ply's parser generator. The grammar rules are defined in `64011658_64011594.grammar`. The parser processes the tokenized input, generates a parse tree, and writes the bracketed notation to `64011658_64011594.bracket`.

## CSV Generation

The compiler also generates a CSV file (`64011658_64011594.csv`) containing information about variables, their types, and values found in the source code.

## Code Generation

The code generation module (`code_generator.py`) translates the parsed input into assembly code. The resulting assembly code is written to `64011658_64011594.asm`.
